Validating Part 1:

1. For REACH horizontal plane movement, use Modeling_Part1 file.
2. Run using CopelliaSimEdu.
3. Run the simulation and note the parameter for Gripper_Actuator (revolute joint), it says 0.17. That is the higher boundary limit for the gripper, lower being zero. 
4. Correspondingly, note down the values for wrist joint, elbow joint and shoulder joint. Here, D1=D+0.17
5. Verify with the values displayed in MATLAB for the same. 
6. Tabulating the same here and comparing: 	
	
	Joint		Value in MATLAB			Value in CopelliaSim
	Shoulder	-22.7326			-22.74	
	Elbow		75.6285				75.64
	Wrist		-52.8959			-52.90

7. Now, rerun the simulation and try to pause the video at a random value of displacement for gripper actuation, before simulation ends.
8. For this point, let us try to change the corresponding D1 value in MATLAB, as obtained in our recording. Here, D1 = D+0.0846.
9. Now, obtaining the calculated values from MATLAB for joint angles and comparing with the obtained values from simulation.

	Joint		Value in MATLAB			Value in CopelliaSim
	Shoulder	-4.8099				-4.81
	Elbow		25.0229				25.04
	Wrist		-20.21				-20.23
