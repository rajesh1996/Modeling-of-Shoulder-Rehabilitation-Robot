# Modeling-of-Shoulder-Rehabilitation-Robot







The REACH robot is an assistive device that is used to aid patients who are not able to stretch their
shoulders and elbows, providing an exercise to their arms and thus strengthening their muscles.


Problem Statement - For the given chosen desired path y(t), Compute the required actuator force profile Fa(t) required
to power the robot end effector to aid in assisting the patient. Also, model the human arm as a 7-
DOF machine and show its interaction with the robot, which eventually constrains the arm to
move along the same plane as the robotâ€™s base. Verify that the obtained joint angles during the
simulation matches with the analytically solved angles using Inverse Kinematics. Further,
simulate the force of interaction between human digits and the robot end effector, based on the
different instantaneous acceleration values obtained for the gripper.
